# MonkePhone:
MonkePhone is a utility mod for Gorilla Tag founded by [Striker](https://github.com/Striker-67) and [Biotest](https://github.com/biotest052) with development led by [Dev](https://github.com/developer9998). Although it is often regarded as an overrated photo capture mod, in reality its not just that.

On the Google Drive it consists of two different major parts of development and something deeper.
- Firstly it has all photos taken and uploaded to the testing server at the start of 2024.
- All photos posted in the publicly visiable "MonkeGram" channel in dev9998's discord server.
- Lastly, Dev + Striker and Bio havent just created a mod. Over the vast time from the start of 2024 to the end of 2025 they have given more people access to post these photos to what you can view on the Google Drive. They have met new people and had experiences which they will never forget.
