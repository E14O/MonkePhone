# MonkePhone:
MonkePhone is a utility mod for Gorilla Tag founded by [Striker](https://github.com/Striker-67) and [Biotest](https://github.com/biotest052) with development led by [Dev](https://github.com/developer9998). Although it is often regarded as an overrated photo capture mod we have added more functions which you can read about below.

All edits to this has nothing to do with any developers listed above. All edits are solely from the contributors to this fork.
If you want the original version of MonkePhone it can be located [here](https://github.com/developer9998/MonkePhone).

## Whats this fork for?
The following changes have been made to this fork due to dev9998 publicly disliking this mod and we predict that there will be no major content update in the foreseeable future.

This fork has many changes from the original that dev9998 made. We have re-designed the lock screen bring function by adding a action button which can directly open apps of your choice you can change what app it opens in settings. We have also fully re-designed the home screen adding a app bar at the bottom to make it look more stylish. The big change in this version is the function of both music app and leaderboard app. Networking has been changed as well now the screen/app that the other user is on will show on there phone but if someone is NOT using this version of MonkePhone the other users phone will stay on camera app for a seemless networking experince amongst all monke phone users even if they are using the original posted on devs github.

Lastly, Dev9998s original monke phone emojis are subject to copyright. We have created our own MonkePhone emoji and swapped all the special cosmetics to ones which are not subject to copyright.
